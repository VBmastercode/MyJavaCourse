The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were developed by Sun from 1995 (May 23, 1995, Java 1.0).
James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree. Now, Java it is the name of a platform and language var.
var Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
With the advent of Java 2 (JDK 1.2, released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998â€“1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.
